  * Part 2: Configure the Wireless Router
  * Part 3: Configure IP Addressing and Test Connectivity
## Instructions
### Part 1: Connect the Devices
In the process of setting up home network, the connection of devices involves two main steps: connecting coaxial cables and network cables.
#### Step 1: Connecting Coaxial Cables
* ##### Accessing the Network Components: 
I started by clicking on the 'Connections' icon, represented by a lightning bolt, in the Network Components section.
* ##### Selecting the Coaxial Cable: 
Next, I located and clicked on the icon for the Coaxial cable, which is depicted as a blue zigzag line.
* ##### Connecting to the Cable Splitter: 
I then clicked on the Cable Splitter and selected the Coaxial1 port to initiate the connection.
* ##### Linking to the Cable Modem:
Following that, I clicked on the Cable Modem and chose Port 0 to establish the internet service connection.
* ##### Connecting the Television:
I repeated the earlier steps but this time, I connected Coaxial2 from the Cable Splitter to Port 0 on the TV to set up the video service.
* ##### Activating the TV:
Finally, I clicked on the TV and then clicked 'ON' for Status. Upon successful connections, an image representing a TV program appeared, confirming that everything was set up correctly.
#### Step 2: Connect the network cables
* ##### Accessing Connection Tools:
   I begin by opening the 'Connections' section and selecting the 'Copper Straight-Through cable', which is represented by a solid black line.
* ##### Connecting the Cable Modem to the Router:
   Next, I connect Port 1 on the Cable Modem directly to the Internet port of the Home Wireless Router. This is essential for providing internet access to the network.
* ##### Connecting the Office PC:
   I then proceed to the Office PC and plugin the cable to the FastEthernet0 port. I navigate to the Home Wireless Router and connect the other end of the cable to the GigabitEthernet 1 port, establishing the network connection for the office PC.
* ##### Connecting the Bedroom PC:
   Following the same steps, I connect the Bedroom PC by plugging one end of another Ethernet cable into the FastEthernet0 port of the PC. I then connect the other end to the GigabitEthernet 2 port on the Home Wireless Router.

By following these steps, I have successfully set up a wired network that connects both PCs in Natsumiâ€™s home to the internet via the cable TV provider network, ensuring stable and reliable internet and network access.
