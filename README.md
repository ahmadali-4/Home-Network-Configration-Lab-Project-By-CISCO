## Instructions
### Part 1: Connect the Devices
In the process of setting up home network, the connection of devices involves two main steps: connecting coaxial cables and network cables.
#### Step 1: Connecting Coaxial Cables
#### Accessing the Network Components: 
I started by clicking on the 'Connections' icon, represented by a lightning bolt, in the Network Components section.
# Selecting the Coaxial Cable: 
Next, I located and clicked on the icon for the Coaxial cable, which is depicted as a blue zigzag line.
# Connecting to the Cable Splitter: 
I then clicked on the Cable Splitter and selected the Coaxial1 port to initiate the connection.
# Linking to the Cable Modem:
Following that, I clicked on the Cable Modem and chose Port 0 to establish the internet service connection.
# Connecting the Television:
I repeated the earlier steps but this time, I connected Coaxial2 from the Cable Splitter to Port 0 on the TV to set up the video service.
# Activating the TV:
Finally, I clicked on the TV and then clicked 'ON' for Status. Upon successful connections, an image representing a TV program appeared, confirming that everything was set up correctly.
